                The goal of this web application is to classify different cancer types and distinguish between benign and malignant 
                cancer tissue samples with a focus on developing novel feature transformations. It is a automated pipeline for 
                the fundamental steps of a AI/ML pipeline from data preprocessing, model training, to model evaluation on test data.

                1. Click on the `Preprocess Data` tab in the sidebar. Select the cancer type you are interested in analyzing and then click on the `Prepare Data` button to transform
                   the data. 
                2. Next, click on the `Train Model` tab in the sidebar. Select the number of epochs you want to train the model and then click on the `Train Model` button.
                3. Lastly, click on the `Cancer Classification` tab to use your trained model to make an inference on test data.
